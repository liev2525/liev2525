# Hi there, I'm Elizabeth Elizondo! 👋

## About Me 🚀

After several years as an educator, I followed my curiosity into data—first through self-study and personal projects, then through formal training and hands-on experience. I’ve built pipelines, wrangled messy datasets, optimized workflows, and collaborated with analysts and stakeholders to turn raw information into actionable insights.

What sets me apart? I know how to break down complex systems, learn quickly, and communicate clearly with technical and non-technical audiences. My background may be non-traditional, but it's my superpower: I bridge gaps between people and data.

- 🌱 Currently learning: Machine Learning and AI
- 🔭 Working on: I’m currently working on Global Anti-Money Laundering (GAML) Data Staging on Enterprise Microsoft Azure solution to support enterprise data needs by enabling GAML to better address future regulatory and business needs.
- 🌍 Languages: English, Intermediate Spanish
- 💡 I'm interested in Data Analysis, Automation, and Machine Learning.
- 💬 Talk to me about Card Games, Education Technology, Healthy Eating, and Crocheting.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to garden fruits and vegetables.
