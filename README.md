# Profile
After several years as an educator, I followed my curiosity into dataâ€”first through self-study and personal projects, then through formal training and hands-on experience. Iâ€™ve built pipelines, wrangled messy datasets, optimized workflows, and collaborated with analysts and stakeholders to turn raw information into actionable insights.

What sets me apart? I know how to break down complex systems, learn quickly, and communicate clearly with technical and non-technical audiences. My background may be non-traditional, but it's my superpower: I bridge gaps between people and data.

All About Me:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Global Anti-Money Laundering Source to Target Mapping Projects.

ðŸ’¡ I'm interested in Data Analysis, Automation, and Machine Learning.

ðŸ’¬ Talk to me about Card Games, Education Technology, Healthy Eating, and Crocheting.

âš¡ Fun fact, I like to garden fruits and vegetables.
