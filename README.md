## About Me 🚀

After several years as an educator, I followed my curiosity into data—first through self-study and personal projects, then through formal training and hands-on experience. I’ve built pipelines, wrangled messy datasets, optimized workflows, and collaborated with analysts and stakeholders to turn raw information into actionable insights.

What sets me apart? I know how to break down complex systems, learn quickly, and communicate clearly with technical and non-technical audiences. My background may be non-traditional, but it's my superpower: I bridge gaps between people and data.
